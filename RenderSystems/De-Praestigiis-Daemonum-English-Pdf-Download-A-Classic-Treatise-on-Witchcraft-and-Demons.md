De Praestigiis Daemonum, which translates to "On the Tricks of Demons", is one of the most influential and controversial works on witchcraft and demonology ever written. It was first published in Latin in 1563, and later translated into English by John Shea in 1991.
 
In this book, Weyer, a physician and a follower of Paracelsus, challenges the prevailing views on witchcraft and demons that were held by the Catholic Church and most of his contemporaries. He argues that most cases of witchcraft are actually caused by mental illness, deception, or natural phenomena, and that demons have limited power and cannot harm humans without God's permission.
 
He also criticizes the methods and motives of witch-hunters and inquisitors, who he accuses of torturing and killing innocent people for personal gain or religious fanaticism. He advocates for a more humane and rational approach to dealing with suspected witches and demoniacs, based on medical and legal principles.
 
De Praestigiis Daemonum is not only a fascinating historical document, but also a valuable source of information on the beliefs and practices of witchcraft and demonology in the 16th century. It contains detailed descriptions of various types of demons, their names, ranks, abilities, and appearances, as well as numerous accounts of witch trials, exorcisms, spells, charms, curses, and other supernatural phenomena.
